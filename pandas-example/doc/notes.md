Command line: C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe '--init-file' 'c:\Users\Peter\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app/out/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/scripts/shellIntegration-bash.sh'
```

- It appears to override the `.venv` configuration I already have setup in this folder, figure this out, but not a big deal for now
